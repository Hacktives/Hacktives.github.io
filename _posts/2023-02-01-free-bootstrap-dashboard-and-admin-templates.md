### Free Bootstrap Dashboard and Admin Templates 

<div></div>In the past, the admin section of a web application tended to be built solely for functionality with little, if any, consideration for design. Thankfully, things have changed. Powerful functionality and beautiful design, especially over the last few years, have been merging nicely. And with the massive rise in popularity of the Bootstrap framework, creating a beautiful and functional admin panel has never been easier.

Why would you choose to use Bootstrap at all? Well, with Bootstrap, you know exactly what you are getting. It is relatively easy to customize a mobile-first framework that includes ready-made design patterns and comes packaged with a vast library of components and widgets. And perhaps more importantly, your Bootstrap build will look consistent across all screen resolutions and platforms. So it does make sense to build the dashboard or the admin panel of your web application with something that you know works well.

All of the free Bootstrap (mostly version 5) admin and dashboard templates and themes below have been pre-built to be used as a complete solution so that you can rapidly create the front-end dashboard of your web app. As well as all of Bootstrap’s handy collection of widgets, they all include many extra addons, plugins, and features (plugins for charts and graphs, calendars, file managers, and so much more). Everything you will ever need for building professional and responsive dashboards

And on top of all of those features, these free templates have all been beautifully designed as well.
