</span>

<div style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; outline: 0px; position: relative;"><span style="font-family: Fira Sans;"># <span style="color: #323130; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This guide is meant to help you understand how Bing finds, indexes, and ranks websites.</span></span>

# <span style="color: #323130; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following these guidelines will help your site be indexed by Bing and will help you optimize your site to increase its chances of ranking relevant queries in Bing search results. Please pay particular attention to the guidelines in the Abuse and Examples of Things to Avoid sections to ensure your site complies with the rules and will not be found as a spam site, which could lead to a demotion or even removal of your website from Bing search results. How Bing finds and indexes your site Help Bing find all your pages</span></span>

# <span style="color: #323130; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitemaps: Sitemaps are an important way for Bing to find your website’s URLs and content. This is a file where you provide information about URLs and files and other content such as images and videos on your website. A sitemap tells crawlers which pages and files you believe are important on your site, and provides additional information, such as when the page was last updated. We strongly recommend using an XML sitemap file to help Bing find all relevant URLs and content on your website. Please keep the sitemap file as current as possible, refreshing it in real-time or at least once a day to remove old URLs and dead links once related content is removed from your website. </span></span>

# <span style="color: #323130; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span></span>

# <span style="color: #323130; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make your sitemap available to Bing by: Submitting it to Bing using the Bing Webmaster Tools Sitemap tool</span></span>

# <span style="color: #323130; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include the following lines in the robots.txt file, specifying the path to your sitemap: Sitemap: http://example.com/sitemap\_location.xml </span></span>

# <span style="color: #323130; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Bing knows your sitemap, Bing will crawl it regularly – no need to submit it again except in case of a major site change.</span></span>

<div><span style="color: #323130; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span></span></div># <span style="color: #323130; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">General sitemap guidelines:</span></span>

# <span style="color: #323130; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Bing knows your sitemap, it will crawl it regularly – there’s no need to submit it again unless there’s a major site change. General sitemap guidelines: Bing supports several sitemap formats including XML, RSS, mRSS, and Atom 1.0, and simple text files. Use consistent URLs. Bing will only crawl URLs exactly as listed. Please only canonical list URL in sitemap. If your website has multiple versions (http vs https, or mobile vs desktop), we recommend only pointing to one version in your sitemap. If you decide to have a unique URL experience for mobile vs desktop, please describe it with the rel=”alternate” attribute. If you have multiple pages for different languages ​​or regions, use the hreflang annotation tags in your sitemap or HTML tags to identify alternative URLs. Use the &lt;lastmod&gt; attribute which is set to the date and time the content and URL were last modified. Maximum sitemap size is 50,000 URLs / 50MB uncompressed. If your site is very large, consider breaking up the large sitemap into smaller sitemaps, then use the sitemap index file to list all the individual sitemaps. View your sitemap in the robots.txt file. If you haven’t changed your sitemap since Bing last crawled it, you don’t need or need to resubmit it. Using a sitemap does not guarantee that all items in a sitemap will be crawled and indexed; however, in most cases, you will benefit from having a sitemap that provides recommendations and guidance for crawlers.</span></span>

<div style="color: #323130; font-size: large;"></div></span></a></div>- <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; outline: 0px; position: relative;"><span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;">Use the </span></a>[<span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;">Bing URL or Content Submission API</span>](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/url-submission-api) to instantly index your updated website content on Bing as soon as new content has been added, updated or deleted. If you cannot adopt the URL and Content submission API, we recommend either submitting the updated URLs directly through [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/how-to-submit-sitemaps-82a15bd4) or by including them in your sitemap.  
      
    </span>
- <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; outline: 0px; position: relative;"><span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;">Links</span></a>: Links are traditionally regarded as a signal of website popularity, the best way to get other sites to link to you is to create high quality and unique content. Bing’s crawler (Bingbot) follows links within your website (internal links) or from other sites (external links) to help Bing discover new content and new pages on your site.  
      
    Bing recommends that all pages on a site are linked to at least one other discoverable and crawlable page.</span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Crawlable links are <span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">&lt;a&gt;</span> </span>tags with an <span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">href</span> </span>attribute. The referring link should include either a text or an image alt attribute that is relevant to the page.</span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Limit the number of links on a page to a reasonable quantity, no more than a few thousand links per page.</span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Make a reasonable effort to ensure that any paid or advertisement links on your site use <span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">rel</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">=”</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">nofollow</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">“</span> or <span style="box-sizing: border-box;">rel</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">=”</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">sponsored</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">“</span> or <span style="box-sizing: border-box;">rel</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">=”</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">ugc</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">“</span> </span>attribute to prevent the links from being followed by a crawler and from potentially impacting search rankings.</span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Bing rewards links that have grown organically; that is, links that have been added over time by content creators on other trusted, relevant websites that drive real users from their site to yours. Plan to build links both internally and externally, in an organic manner.</span>
    
    <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">  
    Abusive tactics that aim to inflate the number and nature of inbound links such as links buying, participating in link schemes (link farms, link spamming and excessive link manipulation) can lead to your site being penalized and delisted from the Bing index.

Avoid duplicative content within your site; help us dedupe duplicate content by:</span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Avoiding outputting different URLs with the same content by using the [Canonical Tag ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element#Implementation).</span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Configuring your website and URL Parameters to improve crawl efficiency and help reduce multiple variations of the same URL pointing to the same content.</span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">[Avoid mobile-specific URLs ](https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2012/03/07/building-websites-optimized-for-all-platforms-desktop-mobile-etc/). Prefer using the same URL for desktop and mobile users.

If the move is temporary, i.e. less than one day, use a [302 temporary redirect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302). Avoid using a [<span style="box-sizing: border-box;">rel=canonical </span>tag ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element)in place of a proper redirect when site content has moved from one location to another.

We encourage Webmasters to allow Bingbot to quickly and deeply crawl sites to ensure as much content as possible is discovered and indexed.

Bing recommends [Dynamic Rendering ](https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/october-2018/bingbot-Series-JavaScript,-Dynamic-Rendering,-and-Cloaking-Oh-My)to switch between client-side rendered and pre-rendered content for specific user agents such as Bingbot especially for large web sites.

Expedite content removal by using the [Bing Content Removal and Page Removal tools ](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/bing-content-removal-tool-cb6c294d). Content removal requests may last for a maximum of 90 days and need to be renewed or content may reappear in the search results.

Robots.txt is primarily used to instruct and manage crawler traffic, for example you can tell Bingbot not to crawl less helpful content such as search result pages or login pages.</span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Place the robots.txt in your root directory (the topmost directory) of your website. Do not place it in a subdirectory.</span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Blocking Bing from crawling a page is likely to remove the page from the index. However, using Disallow does not guarantee that a page will not appear within the index or search results. If you would like to block a specific page from getting crawled or indexed, you should use the noindex robots meta tag instead of disallowing it in the robots.txt.</span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Review your robots.txt often or review URLs disallowed by robots.txt in Bing Webmaster Tools to ensure it remains accurate.</span>

## Help Bing understand your pages

<span face=""Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #323130;"></span>

<span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Bing seeks information-rich, useful and engaging content that is made for people, not for search engines. By creating clear, unique, high-quality, relevant and easy-to-find content on your website, Bing is more likely to index and show your content in search results.</span>

- <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; outline: 0px; position: relative;"><span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;">Content</span></a>: Websites that are thin on content, showing mostly ads or affiliate links, or that otherwise redirect visitors away to other sites quickly tend to not rank well on Bing – in some cases, may not get indexed at all. Your content should be easy to navigate, should be rich and engaging to the website visitor, and provide the information they seek.  
      
    </span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;"><span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;">Create content for searchers not search engines: </span>Develop rich content based on [keyword research ](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/keyword-research-tool-628070b6)that shows what search users the information they are looking for.  
          
        </span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;"><span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;">Create enough content</span> to fully meet the visitor’s expectations. There are no hard and fast rules on the number of words per page, but providing more relevant content is usually better..  
          
        </span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;"><span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;">Make it unique.</span> Do not reuse content from other sources. It is critical that content on your page must be unique in its final form. If you choose to host content from a third party, either use the canonical tag <span style="box-sizing: border-box;">(<span style="box-sizing: border-box;">rel</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">=”</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">canonical</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">“</span> </span>to identify the original source or use the alternate tag <span style="box-sizing: border-box;">(<span style="box-sizing: border-box;">rel</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">=”</span> <span style="box-sizing: border-box;">alternate</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">“</span>)</span>.  
          
        </span>
    - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;"><span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;">Images and Videos:</span> Use unique and original images and videos that are relevant to the topic of the page. Bing can extract information from images, captions, structured data, titles, and related text such as transcripts.</span>
        - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Do not embed important text or information within images or videos. Optical Character Recognition is less reliable than html text, and it is not accessible. [Alt text ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute)improves accessibility for people and devices that cannot see images on pages. When choosing alt text, focus on creating information-rich content that uses keywords appropriately to give context to the image related to the content of the page.</span>
        - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Include descriptive titles, filenames, and text for images and video.</span>
        - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Videos must be in a supported format to be crawled and the video must not be blocked behind a paywall-protection or logins.</span>
        - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Subtitles and captions can be used for videos to help make your content available to a wider audience and to provide Search Engines a textual representation of the content in video and audio files.</span>
        - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Choose high-quality photos and videos, they appeal more to users than blurry or out-of-focus images.</span>
        - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Optimize images and videos to improve page load times. Images are often the largest contributor to page size, which can make pages slow to load.</span>
        
        <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">

Bing uses machine learning to help categorize images, however the strongest signal is self-marked adult pages and content. We recommend you help Bing understand Adult-Only images and content by:</span>
        - <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Using <span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">&lt;meta name </span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">=”</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">rating</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">“</span> <span style="box-sizing: border-box;">content</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">=”</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">adult</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">“&gt;</span></span></span>

## How Bing ranks your content

<span face=""Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #323130;"></span>

<span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Bing search results are generated by using an algorithm to match the search query a user enters into the search engine with content in our index. Bing designs – and continually improves – its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant and useful collection of search results available.  
</span>

<span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Please take note that there is no ability for sites to improve their algorithmic ranking by providing renumeration to Bing. Instead, websites can choose to advertise on Bing through [Microsoft Advertising ](https://ads.microsoft.com/). Learn more about how paid search [ads are ranked ](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50825/0)within search results. In the Bing Shopping experience, payment from sellers participating in our Microsoft Shopping campaign program is one of several factors that influences ranking of these results. Sellers provide pricing and product information to Bing through [shopping feeds files ](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51105/1). Additionally, advertisers can showcase [local in store products and local retail store information ](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56858/1-500)to nearby shoppers on Bing.com. Learn more about the [shopping campaign program ](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50903/1-500).  
</span>

<span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Bing does not prioritize Microsoft products or services in algorithmic search results. Outside of core algorithmic search results, Bing may on occasion provide a standalone answer box or banner promoting a Microsoft product or service related to the search term provided, such as ensuring users know that Bing works best with the Microsoft Edge browser.  
</span>

<span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank content. These are listed in general order of importance, but please note that Bing’s complex ranking systems use many criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters described below may vary from search to search and may evolve over time.  
</span>

- <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;"><span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; outline: 0px; position: relative;">Relevance:</a></span> Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page as well as terms used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning.  
      
    </span>
- <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;"><span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; outline: 0px; position: relative;">Quality and Credibility:</a></span> Determining the quality and credibility of a website includes an evaluation of the page itself, including such factors as the author’s or site’s reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain cite data sources; Bing may demote content that includes name-calling, offensive statements, or uses derogatory language to make a point), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship.  
      
    </span>
- <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;"><span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; outline: 0px; position: relative;">User engagement:</a></span> Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through to or did they quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages.  
      
    </span>
- <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;"><span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; outline: 0px; position: relative;">Freshness:</a></span> Generally Bing prefers content that is more “fresh” – meaning that the page consistently provides up-to-date information. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly.  
      
    </span>
- <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;"><span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; outline: 0px; position: relative;">Location:</a></span> In ranking results Bing considers where the user is located (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the document, or the location of other visitors to the page.  
      
    </span>
- <span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;"><span face=""Segoe UI Semibold", "Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 600; line-height: 1.4;"><a style="box-sizing: border-box; outline: 0px; position: relative;">Page load time:</a></span> Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and an unsatisfactory search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.  
    </span>

<span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user. For example, pages offering adult content are not available when SafeSearch is set to “Strict” mode. As another example, pages promoting potentially harmful content, such as where a site promotes methods of suicide or purports to sell opioids or other potentially harmful drugs, may be downranked.  
</span>

# Abuse and Examples of Things to Avoid

<span face=""Segoe UI", "Segoe UI Web (West European)", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #323130;"></span>

<span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Search Engine Optimization is a legitimate practice which seeks to improve technical and content aspects of a website, making the content easier to find, relevant, and more accessible to search engine crawlers. The majority of SEO practices render a website that is more appealing to Bing, however, performing SEO-related work does not guarantee rankings will improve or sites will receive an increase in traffic from Bing. Further, taken to extremes, some SEO practices can be abused which result in penalties by search engines.  
</span>

<span style="font-family: Fira Sans; font-size: medium;">Sites which engage in abuse such as the practices outlined below are considered to be low quality. As a result, these sites can incur ranking penalties, have site markup ignored, and may not be selected for indexation. These Bing Webmaster Guidelines describe only some of the most widespread forms of inappropriate, manipulative or misleading behaviors. Microsoft may take action against your site for any inappropriate or deceptive practices, even those not described here. If you feel action has been taken against your site, you can use Bing Webmaster Tools to contact our support team. Additionally, users can report abuse of any of these practices using the feedback link in the footer of bing.com after performing a search which reproduces the issue. An example of this can be seen here.

Showing users different content than what the crawlers can see may be seen as a spam tactic and could be detrimental to your website’s rankings, leading your site to being de-listed from Bing index. Websites should be extremely cautious about responding differently to crawlers as opposed to regular visitors, and should not use cloaking as a principle.

Manipulating inbound links to artificially inflate the number of links pointed at a website can lead to your site being delisted from Bing index.

The reality is social media schemes are easy to see in action and the value of the website value is deprecated. Auto follows encourage follower growth on social sites such as Twitter, and work by automatically following anyone who follows you. Over time this creates a scenario where the number of followers you have is more or less the same as the number of people following you. This does not indicate you have a strong influence. Following relatively few people while having a high follower count would tend to indicate a stronger influential voice.

This issue should be managed by fixing the root cause of the problem. The <span style="box-sizing: border-box;">rel=canonical </span>element can also be used but should be seen as a secondary solution to that of fixing the core problem. If excessive parameterization is causing duplicate content issue, we encourage you to use the [URL Inspection tool ](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/URL-Inspection-55a30305).

Instead of republishing content from other sites without adding any original content or value, you should create your own content that differentiates your own website. Slightly modifying and republishing content from other sites also constitutes scraping.

Stuffing your content with specific keywords with the sole intent of artificially inflating the probability of ranking for specific search terms is in violation of our guidelines and can lead to demotion or even the delisting of your website from our search results.

Content like this is considered malicious, and normally contains garbage text that was only created to garnish a higher ranking. This type of content will result in penalties.

It can lead to demotion or even the delisting of your website from our search results.

Malicious behavior can lead to demotion or even the delisting of your website from our search results.
